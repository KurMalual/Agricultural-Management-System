# Agricultural-Management
Description of the concept of my Mission. 

My G.C.G.O.s are climate change, Agriculture, and job creation. As per this project, I will be focusing on Agriculture since the issue of climate change is my long-term goal.
My mission for agriculture is to develop a comprehensive software solution to tackle the challenge of the agricultural supply chain and production. As we know, the basics of Agriculture refer to the rearing of livestock and farming; agriculture is a broader occupation, and I will solely focus on the crop production part because is one of the significant challenges affecting my country. 
We have many fertile lands, but they need to be cultivated, and also, there are farmers whose products don't reach the capital market because of lack of exposure.
Agriculture is the backbone of any country that practices it effectively and efficiently to satisfy the needs of all.
I will design a website connecting farmers, business people, truck drivers, and tractors because there has been a significant gap between those stakeholders, leading to the deterioration in the quality of farm sales and spoiled products.

Problem statement;
There has been a significant gap between the farmers and the market, leading to farm products needing help to reach the market at a desirable time. Sometimes, when the farm products get to the market, there is consistently high competition between the farmers who produce the same product. For example, when a farmer who sells his tomatoes brings his tomatoes to the market, they find other tomatoes already in the market, thus leading to the spoiling of tomatoes. Secondly, some farmers need help finding trucks to transport their yield to the market, making the process tedious.
Lastly, some farmers need help looking for tractors to cultivate their farmland during the rainy season and are also affected by the price even if they can get tractors to plow their lands.

Insufficient or oversupply:
Lack of real-time visibility and coordination among stakeholders in the supply chain contributes to losses and waste, and this happens because the people in business and farmers need better communication. Sometimes, a farmer may take his products to the market, yet the previous products are still on the market.

Poor connection between truck distributors, farmers, and customers:
There needs to be a better connection between truck drivers, farmers, and customers. Due to the unavailability of the transporting vehicles, they don't have a direct relationship, making it difficult for the farmers to transport their products to the market on time.

Limited Access to Markets:
Smallholder farmers often need help to connect with broader markets, restricting their income-generating opportunities
Lack of communication between the farmers and customers/business people:
This is also a challenge since the customers need a direct communication medium to get the supply on time.
Difficulty in getting tractors:
Many farmers find it challenging to get the tractors to cultivate their land, making it time-consuming as they take time to search for the tractors.

Software development model 
The selected software development model for this project is the Agile model.
The flexibility and adaptability of Agile shine when it comes to student-based software projects. It will help me to benefit from iterative sprints, delivering early value, focusing on user satisfaction, mitigating risks, and experiencing real-world development practices. The agricultural supply chain is a complex system with diverse stakeholders, and the Agile model allows for continuous collaboration, regular feedback, and the ability to respond to changing requirements. The flexibility of Agile will enable us to address any emerging challenges during the development process.

Online Agricultural Marketplace:
          Problem Addressed: Gap between farmers and the market, spoilage due to oversupply
         Solution: Develop an online platform where farmers can list and sell their products directly to consumers or wholesalers. This allows them to reach a broader market and avoid oversupply issues.

Crop Planning and Coordination:
Problem Addressed: High competition in the market for the same product.
Solution: Implement a crop planning feature on the website. Farmers can input their planned harvest dates, and the platform can provide insights into market demand for specific crops, helping farmers avoid oversaturation of particular products.

Transportation Services:
Problem Addressed: Need help finding trucks for transportation.
Solution: Integrate a feature where farmers can connect with available transportation services. Truck owners or logistics companies can register on the platform to offer services. This facilitates efficient and timely transportation of agricultural products.

Equipment Sharing Platform:
Problem Addressed: Need help finding tractors for cultivation.
Solution: Create a section where farmers can share information about available tractors for rent or hire. This helps farmers access the necessary equipment during critical times like the rainy season. Include a rating and review system to ensure reliability.

Mobile-Friendly Design:
Problem Addressed: Limited access to technology in rural areas.
Solution: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly, as many farmers may access it via smartphones. I will develop a mobile app for easier access sometimes.

Partnerships and Integration:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Solution: Collaborate with local agricultural agencies, NGOs, and government bodies to gather data, provide support, and integrate existing agricultural initiatives into the platform.

Training and Workshops:
Problem Addressed: Limited knowledge of technology and online platforms.
Solution: Offer online training sessions or workshops to help farmers understand and utilize the platform effectively.
